## Unit Test

---

### Configure Dependencies
For Unit Testing add the following dependencies:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fitbur.testify.junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>unit-test</artifactId>
    <version>latest</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.12</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
    <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.31-beta</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

### Example Unit Test
Given a `Greeter` class with a single `Greeting` collaborator:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
public class Greeter {

    private final Greeting greeting;

    public Greeter(Greeting greeting) {
        this.greeting = greeting;
    }

    public String greet() {
        return greeting.phrase();
    }

    public Greeting getGreeting() {
        return greeting;
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
public interface Greeting {

    String phrase();

}
{% endhighlight %}

The unit test for the `Greeter` class would look:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@RunWith(UnitTest.class)
public class GreeterTest {

    @Cut
    Greeter cut;

    @Fake
    Greeting greeting;

    @Before
    public void verifyInjection() {
        assertThat(cut).isNotNull();
        assertThat(greeting).isNotNull();
        assertThat(cut.getGreeting()).isSameAs(greeting);
    }

    @Test
    public void callToGreetShouldReturnHello() {
        //Arrange
        String phrase = "Hello";
        given(greeting.phrase()).willReturn(phrase);

        //Act
        String result = cut.greet();

        //Assert
        assertThat(result).isEqualTo(phrase);
        verify(greeting).phrase();
        verifyNoMoreInteractions(greeting);
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

UnitTest? @Cut? @Fake? WTFIT?

The first thing you will notice in the above unit test class is that it is
annotated with `@RunWith(UnitTest.class)`. `UnitTest` is a custom JUnit `Runner`
implementation that configures, verifies, wires, and executes the test class.

The next thing you will notice are two annotations, `@Cut` and `@Fake`. The
`@Cut`annotation denotes the Class Under Test (CUT) and `@Fake` denotes the desire to
fake the `Greeter` class's `Greeting` collaborator. These annotations inform
the framework what we are testing and behind the scene Testify inspects the test
class fields and the constructor of the class under test, it then:

1. creates a fake instance of `Greeting` class
1. an instance of `Greeter` class with the fake instance of `Greeting` as its collaborator
1. initializes the test class's `cut` and `greeting` fields

One other key feature of Testify of note is the fact that a new `Greeter` and
fake `Greeting` instances are created for each test case. This means your tests
run in complete isolation and you do not have to worry about managing state
between test runs. Everything is take care of for you so you can focus on
writing your test cases not boilerplate code to manage test state.

## Spring Integration Test

---

### Configure Dependencies
For Spring Integration Testing add the following dependencies:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fitbur.testify.junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-integration-test</artifactId>
    <version>latest</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
    <version>4.2.3.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.12</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
    <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.31-beta</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

### Example Spring Integration Test
Given a `Greeter` service with a single `Greeting` collaborator:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@Named
public class Greeter {

    private final Greeting greeting;

    @Inject
    Greeter(Greeting greeting) {
        this.greeting = greeting;
    }

    public String greet() {
        return greeting.phrase();
    }

    public Greeting getGreeting() {
        return greeting;
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
public interface Greeting {

    String phrase();

}
{% endhighlight %}

and the following Spring Java Config and implementation of the `Greeting` contract:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@ComponentScan
@Configuration
@SuppressWarnings("ClassMayBeInterface")
public class GreetingConfig {

}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@Named
public class Hello implements Greeting {

    @Override
    public String phrase() {
        return "Hello";
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

The Spring integration test for the `Greeter` service would look:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@RunWith(SpringIntegrationTest.class)
@Module(GreetingConfig.class)
public class GreeterRealTest {

    @Cut
    Greeter cut;

    @Real
    Greeting greeting;

    @Before
    public void verifyInjection() {
        assertThat(cut).isNotNull();
        assertThat(greeting).isNotNull();
        assertThat(cut.getGreeting()).isSameAs(greeting);
    }

    @Test
    public void callToGreetShouldReturnHello() {
        //Arrange
        String phrase = "Hello";

        //Act
        String result = cut.greet();

        //Assert
        assertThat(result).isEqualTo(phrase);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

SpringIntegrationTest? @Module? @Real? Whaaah?

`SpringIntegrationTest` is similar to `UnitTest` in that it configures,
verifies, wires, and executes the test class.

Since this is an integration test we want to verify proper wiring and
integration between services and their collaborators. Usually this involves
loading a module that defines services and collaborators we are want to test
and working with real objects rather than fake ones.

In `GreeterRealTest` example above the `Greeter` service and its `Greeting`
collaborator are discovered by the Spring Java Config class `GreetingConfig`.
We let Testify know this by annotating the test class with
`@Module(GreetingConfig.class)`. Behind the scenes Testify will create a new
Spring `ApplicationContext`, register and load the `GreetingConfig`
configuration class, and insure that only the services and collaborators we are
testing are initialized by the Spring application context.

We have already seen `@Cut` annotation in action in the previous unit test
example. In the context of a Spring integration test it serves a similar purpose,
to let the Testify know what we are testing. In the example above it happens to
be a `Greeter` service and its `Greeting` collaborator.

As mentioned earlier we typically want to work with real instance of 
collaborators when writing integration tests and so we annotate the `greeting`
field with `@Real` to let the framework know that we want the real instance of
the `Greeting` greeting collaborator managed by Spring. Of course, there are times
when you do not want to use real instance of the class under test's
collaborators (i.e. real credit card processor), and in those instances you can
annotate the `Greeting` collaborator with `@Fake` to work with fake instance of
the collaborator.

What if you want to use the real instance of `Greeting` collaborator but want to stub
or verify certain methods of the collaborator? Well, you can do that too. You
just need to annotate the greeting field with `@Real(true)` to create a fake
instance that delegates to the real instance.

At this point you might be curious as to what is going on behind the scenes:

1. Testify inspects the test class fields and the constructor of the class under test
1. creates a Spring application context and loads the `GreetingConfig` module
1. retrieves all the collaborators of the `Greeter` service from the application context
1. creates a new instance of the `Greeter` services with real instances of its collaborators
1. adds the newly created `Greeter` instance to the application context as a primary bean
1. initializes the test class's `cut` and `greeting` fields.

As with unit tests you do not have to worry about managing test state. Every
Spring integration test case runs in complete isolation. Testify takes
care of managing the Spring application context and all scaffolding.

## Spring System Test

### Configure Dependencies
For Spring System Testing add the following dependencies:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fitbur.testify.junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-system-test</artifactId>
    <version>latest</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-webmvc</artifactId>
    <version>4.2.3.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.12</version>
    <scope>test</scope>

    <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.31-beta</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

### Example Spring Integration Test
Given the following Spring MVC Application:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
public class GreeterApplication extends AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer {

    @Override
    protected Class<?>[] getRootConfigClasses() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    protected Class<?>[] getServletConfigClasses() {
        return new Class[]{GreeterWebConfig.class};
    }

    @Override
    protected String[] getServletMappings() {
        return new String[]{"/"};
    }

    @Override
    protected String getServletName() {
        return "GreeterApplication";
    }

}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@Configuration
@EnableWebMvc
@ComponentScan
public class GreeterWebConfig {

}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@Named
public class GreetingService {

    public String phrase() {
        return "Hello";
    }

}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@RestController
public class GreeterResource {

    private final GreetingService greetingService;

    @Autowired
    GreeterResource(GreetingService service) {
        this.greetingService = service;
    }

    @RequestMapping(path = "/", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String greet() {
        return greetingService.phrase();
    }

    public GreetingService getGreetingService() {
        return greetingService;
    }

}

{% endhighlight %}

The Spring System Test for the `GreeterResource` would look:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@RunWith(SpringSystemTest.class)
@App(value = GreeterApplication.class)
public class GreeterResourceClientInstanceTest {

    @Real
    ClientInstance<WebTarget> cut;

    @Test
    public void callToGreetResourceShouldReturnHello() {
        Response result = cut.getClient().path("/").request().get();
        assertThat(result).isNotNull();
        assertThat(result.getStatus()).isEqualTo(OK.getStatusCode());
        assertThat(result.readEntity(String.class)).isEqualTo("Hello");
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

SpringSystemTest? @App? @Cut? ClientInstance? Oh my?

Once again you will note that we are running with `SpringSystemTest` runner. It
is similar to `SpringJunitTest` and `SpringIntegrationTest` in that it also
configures, verifies, wires, and executes the test class.

Since this is a system test we want to verify the application works from the
client perspective. This means we load and start the Spring application in a
servlet container. By default, Testify uses Undertow servlet container but you
have the option of using whatever servlet container you preferred. We will
the ability to use your own servlet container in the advanced topic section.

In `GreeterResourceClientInstanceTest` example above we load the the application
by annotating the test class with `@App(value = GreeterApplication.class)`.
Behind the scenes Testify starts the servlet container and deploys the 
`GreeterApplication` application to it. Testify then creates a client instance
that is aware of the base URI the application is deployed to and injects it into
the test class. By default Testify uses JerseyClient for HTTP/REST communication.
Again, the underlying client implementation is configurable.

Once the server is running, the application is deployed, the client instance
is configured you can start testing the `GreeterResource` by injecting and using
the client instance to test resources form the client perspective.

If you are curious about what is going on behind the scenes, it is pretty
straight forward, Testify:

1. creates a proxy class and instance of `GreetingApplication`
1. creates and starts a new Undertow servlet container instance and deploy the
proxy application to it
1. gets a reference to the running application's Spring application context
1. creates and configures a `ClientInstace` instance aware of the servlet
container's server base URI and adds it to to the running application's Spring
application context
1. initializes the test class's `cut`

As with the other testing levels you do not have to worry about managing
test state. Testify will start the server, configuring and inject the client
before each test and manage the clean up process.

One other feature of note is that Testify supports "In-Container" system testing.
This means you can inject any Spring managed beans in the deployed application
into your test class and execute systems much like integration tests:

{% highlight java linenos=table %}
@RunWith(SpringSystemTest.class)
@App(value = GreeterApplication.class)
public class GreeterResourceDirectTest {

    @Cut
    GreeterResource cut;

    @Real
    GreetingService greetingService;

    @Test
    public void callToGreetShouldReturnHello() {
        assertThat(cut).isNotNull();
        assertThat(greetingService)
                .isNotNull()
                .isSameAs(cut.getGreetingService());

        String result = cut.greet();
        assertThat(result).isEqualTo("Hello");
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}
